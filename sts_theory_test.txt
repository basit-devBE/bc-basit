//what is git and why is it important
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time.
It is important because it helps developers achieve the following
1. Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time.
2. Version Control: Git allows developers to track changes to their code over time, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
3. Branching: Git allows developers to work on different features or fixes in separate branches, making it easy to merge changes back into the main codebase.
4. Remote Repositories: Git allows developers to push their code to remote repositories, making it easy to collaborate with other developers and deploy code to servers.
